#### Discussion:

Setting the framework for Iteration 1, by identifying which stakeholders are involved in the project, understand each of their individual requirements, recognize stakeholders’ level of interest and power in the project, and determine how we are going to communicate with each stakeholder, with these steps complete, we can complete the stakeholder register.

#### Conclusions:

After a discussion, we identified each stakeholder involved in the project, along with their individual requirements, and how we are going to communicate with each stakeholder. We then completed a stakeholder register.
