#### Conclusions:
We are satisfied that we know the resources we require for the project, along with the costs of them, with this knowledge we then completed a Resource Requirement List.

| Agenda Item 2:|**Discuss project planning tools.**|Presenter|**Beth Jones**|
|---------------|------------------------|---------|--------------| 


#### Discussion:

After discussion of project planning tools, we concluded it's important to consider the benefits of creating a Gantt chart for our project. This tool provides a clear and concise overview of the entire project timeline, breaking down the project into smaller tasks and assigning them to specific timeframes. This allows us to identify any potential conflicts or delays early on and allocate resources more efficiently, reducing overall project costs. Also, a Gantt chart helps us to communicate the project plan effectively to stakeholders, building trust and confidence in our project management capabilities. By using a Gantt chart, we can ensure that our project is completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders involved.

#### Conclusions:

After a discussion, we concluded that a Gantt chart would be a suitable tool to ensure each task in our project is completed on time. We then identified each task along with their respective risk and duration. With this knowledge we can complete a Gantt chart for our project.
