| Agenda Item 1:|**Example: Evaluate Resource needs.**|Presenter|**Student name**|
|---------------|------------------------|---------|----------------| 


#### Discussion:
We must determine the resource requirements for our project, document each required resource for each task, and then finalize our costs to satisfy our stakeholders that the project will be completed within budget.
#### Conclusions:
We are satisfied that we know the resources we require for the project, along with the costs of them, with this knowledge we then completed a Resource Requirement List.

| Agenda Item 2:|**Example: Discuss project planning tools.**|Presenter|**Student name**|
|---------------|------------------------|---------|--------------| 


#### Discussion:

After discussing project planning tools, we concluded it's crucial to consider the benefits of creating a Gantt chart for our project. This tool provides a clear and concise overview of the timeline, breaking the project into smaller tasks and assigning them to specific timeframes. This allows us to identify potential conflicts or delays early on and allocate resources more efficiently, reducing project costs. Also, a Gantt chart helps us to communicate the project plan effectively to stakeholders, building trust and confidence in our project management capabilities. Using a Gantt chart, we can ensure that our project is completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders involved.

#### Conclusions:

After a discussion, we concluded that a Gantt chart would be a suitable tool to ensure each task in our project is completed on time. We then identified each task along with their respective risk and duration. With this knowledge, we can create a Gantt chart for our project.

| Agenda Item 3:|**Example: Set up a GitHub repository.**|Presenter|**Student name**|
|---------------|------------------------------|---------|--------------| 

#### Discussion:
Setting up GitHub boards for our project can help us manage tasks and issues organizationally and efficiently, promoting collaboration among team members. We can create boards for each project phase and, within each board, create cards for specific tasks or issues, allowing us to track their status easily. With careful planning and execution, we can use GitHub boards to manage our project effectively, stay on top of issues and tasks, and collaborate remotely to deliver a high-quality outcome.  

#### Conclusions:
