### Minutes

| Agenda Item 1:|**Evaluate risks.**|Presenter|**Liam Palmers**|
|---------------|------------------------|---------|----------------| 


#### Discussion:
Goku Black created and completed a risk register to better understand and evaluate present risks as well as the impact they may have on the project. We acknowledged that by rating these risks we could identify high and likely risks that become a high priority to mitigate or minimize. 

#### Conclusions:
Goku Black has identified the risks within the project as well as its impact and priority. Each risk has been allocated an overseer to monitor after we complete steps to mitigate the likelihood of each risk.

| Agenda Item 2:|**Deploy the website.**|Presenter|**Alex Scott**|
|---------------|------------------------|---------|--------------| 


#### Discussion:

Goku Black has recognized that we must upload the product website to the GitHub repository. We also uploaded individual website components to the GitHub repo (orders, products, about, contact) and published the completed website. We also created a GitBoard with Kanban functions to accurately track tasks within each interaction, minimizing the loss of data integrity.
#### Conclusions:

Goku-Black has uploaded our website and individual components to GitHub and uploaded documentation to align with the updated data so the viewer has easier access.

|---------------|------------------------------|---------|--------------| 

#### Discussion:
Goku-Black is undertaking User Acceptance Testing on the deployed web application to determine if the app meets the requirements. As a group we will determine testing scenarios for our user acceptance testing, and record the status of each requirement, along with remarks about their current state.

#### Conclusions:
Goku-Black has completed User-Acceptance testing on our web-app, we have identified successes but also a few weaknesses within our web app and have recorded the results.
