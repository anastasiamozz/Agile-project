# Agile-project

This assessment aims to plan and control a hypothetical software development project (e-commerce) with supporting documentation. All project planning, documentation, and code must be developed, contained and managed in a GitHub repository. The focus is on familiarising the processes and tools for managing a software project. The main objective is to obtain and apply project management experience to develop websites.
